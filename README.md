# DEPRECATED

The original goal of this repository was to maintain the SVG icons for Material Design after their decision to move away from SVGs to an Icon Font. However, since then they have started regularly updating their SVG icons again. This eliminates the need for this repository.

Use `@material-design-icons/svg` instead now. (https://github.com/google/material-design-icons)

# Material design icons

Material design icons is the official [icon set](https://www.google.com/design/spec/style/icons.html#icons-system-icons) from Google.  The icons are designed under the [material design guidelines](https://material.io/guidelines/).

## Getting Started

Read the [developer guide](https://google.github.io/material-design-icons/) on how to use the material design icons in your project.

### Using a font collection

The `iconfont` folder contains pre-generated font files that can be included in a project. This is especially convenient for the web; however, it is generally better to link to the web font hosted on Google Fonts:

```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons"
      rel="stylesheet">
```

Read more in the [font portion](https://google.github.io/material-design-icons/#icon-font-for-the-web) of our full developer guide.

### Using symbols and sprites

The `css-sprite` and `svg-sprite` folders contain pre-generated sprite sheets, as well as svg symbols that can be `<use>`d more directly and with fewer constraints. Instructions for using them are in the [sprites documentation](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons/tree/master/sprites).
